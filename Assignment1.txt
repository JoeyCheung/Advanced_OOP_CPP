The reason why some compilers work is because of the preprocess, compile, then link build pipeline. There may be different calling conventions say between C and C++ for function headers. That being said if a function is compiled and uses a calling convention from C, but it actually uses C++, it will cause some unexpected results. Which is why some compilers can run the code properly, while others can't.
